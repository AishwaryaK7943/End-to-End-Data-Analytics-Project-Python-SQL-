Basically it is kind of a ETL project where we extracted data from kagal API. 
Then we did data cleaning transformation in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and then connected and loaded into SQL Server(MYSQL WORKBENCH). 
After loading the data, we did some data analysis by answering some interesting questions.
